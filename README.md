# Database Design and Implementation Project

## Introduction

For this assessment, you will create an entity-relationship (ER) model, databases, tables, and queries for two fictional small businesses. You will use SQL to test and run a database application that you will develop. After running the code, you will take screenshots of your results and include them in your submission document.

**Note:** If you don't have access to a database tool, you may use SQL Fiddle (an online SQL tool) to complete this assessment. Instructions for using SQL Fiddle are provided in the attached "SQL Fiddle Instructions" document.

## Scenario

You are a database designer and developer hired by two local businesses, Nora's Bagel Bin and Jaunty Coffee Co., to build databases to help them manage their businesses. Your tasks include:

1. Designing a normalized physical database model for Nora's Bagel Bin's ordering system.
2. Creating a database for Jaunty Coffee Co. using an existing database design document.
3. Loading sample data into the tables.
4. Creating a view and an index to protect and improve query performance.
5. Creating simple and complex queries to produce meaningful reports from the newly created database.

## Requirements

### A. Nora's Bagel Bin Database Model

Construct a normalized physical database model for Nora's Bagel Bin's ordering process:

1. Complete the second normal form (2NF) section:
   a. Assign attributes from 1NF to 2NF tables.
   b. Describe relationships between 2NF tables (cardinality).
   c. Explain your attribute assignment and cardinality determination.

2. Complete the third normal form (3NF) section:
   a. Assign attributes from 2NF to 3NF tables.
   b. Name 3NF tables.
   c. Create linking keys between 3NF tables.
   d. Describe relationships between 3NF tables (cardinality).
   e. Explain your attribute assignment and cardinality determination.

3. Complete the "Final Physical Database Model" section:
   a. Copy table names and cardinality from 3NF diagram.
   b. Assign data types to attributes (use CHAR(), VARCHAR(), TIMESTAMP, INTEGER, and NUMERIC() at least once each).

### B. Jaunty Coffee Co. Database Creation

Create a database using the "Jaunty Coffee Co. ERD":

1. Develop SQL code to create tables:
   a. Provide SQL code for table creation.
   b. Include screenshot of SQL commands and server response.

2. Develop SQL code to populate tables:
   a. Provide SQL code to add at least three rows of data to each table.
   b. Include screenshot of SQL commands and server response.

3. Develop SQL code to create a view:
   a. Provide SQL code for view creation (show Employee table info with concatenated full names).
   b. Include screenshot of SQL commands and server response.

4. Develop SQL code to create an index:
   a. Provide SQL code to create index on coffee_name field.
   b. Include screenshot of SQL commands and server response.

5. Develop SQL code for an SFW query:
   a. Provide SQL code for the query.
   b. Include screenshot of SQL commands and server response.

6. Develop SQL code for a table joins query:
   a. Provide SQL code for a query joining three tables.
   b. Include screenshot of SQL commands and server response.

### C. Submission Format

Submit parts A and B as a PDF, with each part clearly labeled.

### D. Professional Communication

Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.

## Important Notes

- Your submission must be your original work.
- Use the rubric to guide your submission.
- Do not submit cloud links (e.g., Google Docs, OneDrive) unless specified.
- Adhere to academic integrity guidelines regarding quotations and paraphrasing.
